# CC Collection log Spam Hider

This simple plugin hides certain collection log broadcasts that can be perceived as "spammy".
By default the following collection log pages are filtered:
- Fossil island notes
- Chompy bird hats
- My Notes
- Shared clue scroll rewards

By default the following collection log pages are NOT filtered, but can be enabled:
- Castle Wars
- Trouble Brewing
- Brimhaven Agility Arena/Graceful (only Graceful will be blocked)

Clue Scrolls may now also be filtered:
- Beginner clues
- Easy clues (does not include Monk's robes (g) )
- Medium clues (does not include boots)
- Hard clues (does not include 3rd age or gilded)
- Elite clues (does not include Ring of 3rd age, tuxedo pieces, or anything from the Elite (rare) collection log section)
- Master clues (does not include Bloodhound, Ring of 3rd age, Dragon kiteshield/platebody ornament kits, Ankou or Mummy pieces, or anything from the Master (rare) collection log section)
